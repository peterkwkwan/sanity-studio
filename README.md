# Sanity Content Studio

[Sanity Studio](https://www.sanity.io/) is an open source real-time content editing environment connected to the Sanity backend.

Sanity Studio allows easy management of content using a [headless CMS](https://www.sanity.io/headless-cms) approach. Connect content to any frontend via the Sanity API, enabling data fetching from the [Sanity Content Lake](https://www.sanity.io/docs/datastore) backend.

This approach is great for [JAMstack](https://jamstack.wtf/) applications where performance, security and scalability are important factors.
